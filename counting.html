				<h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Counting is the branch of mathematics involving the determination of the number of elements in a given set 
				or collection. Uniquely, counting deals only with finite collections of discrete objects, as opposed to the 
				more common, continuous mathematics. This is also what gives rise to the limitless real world applications 
				of counting which, similar to reality, is concerned with only that which exists. Despite archaeological evidence 
				indicating that humans have been counting for more than 50,000 years, the roots of counting can partially be 
				attributed to 17th to 18th century attempts to analyze the odds of winning at games of chance. Counting can 
				extend far beyond the mundane science of flipping coins. From exploring the realm of possibilities to uncovering 
				the secrets of fundamental language order and structure, counting is an unbelievably beautiful branch of 
				mathematics!</p>

				<h2 id="problems">PROBLEMS</h2>
				<ol>				
					<li>Six chairs are evenly spaced around a circular table. One person is seated in each chair. Each 
					person gets up and sits down in a chair that is not the same and is not adjacent to the chair he or 
					she originally occupied, so that again one person is seated in each chair. In how many ways can this 
					be done? (AMC 12B 2015 Problem 22)</li>
					
					<li>For some positive integers <span class="math">p</span>, there is a quadrilateral 
					<span class="math">ABCD</span> with positive integer side lengths, perimeter <span class="math">p</span>, 
					right angles at <span class="math">B</span> and <span class="math">C</span>, <span class="math">AB</span> = 2, 
					and <span class="math">CD</span> = <span class="math">AD</span>. How many different values of 
					<span class="math">p</span> &lt; 2015 are possible?(AMC 12A 2015 Problem 19)</li>										
				</ol>
				
				<h2 id="solutions">SOLUTIONS</h2>
				<ol>				
					<li>First, consider moving all of the people in their new seats to the left by 3 chairs. 
					As a result, each person will be in a chair that is either the same or adjacent to their 
					original seat. For example, let the chairs be labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. If Person 1 
					originally sat on seat A, then the new seat Person 1 can move to is either seat C, D, or E. 
					From any of those 3 chairs, when Person 1 moves 3 to the left, Person 1 will either end up 
					in seats F, A, or B which are either the same or adjacent to Person 1’s original seat, seat 
					A. So, when all of the people move 3 chairs to the left from their new seat, they will end 
					up in a chair that is either the same or adjacent to their original seat. Thus, this problem 
					is the same as asking how many ways can each person get up and sit down in a chair that is 
					the same or adjacent to their original seat. 
					<br><br>
					Afterwards, split all of the different ways people can choose a new seat into 3 cases.
					<br><br>
					Case 1: 0 people move. There is 1 way this can happen, if everyone chooses their original 
					seat.
					<br><br>
					Case 2: everyone moves in a cycle. There are 2 ways this can happen. One way where everyone 
					shifts to the right by 1 seat; one way where everyone shifts to the left by 1 seat.
					<br><br>
					Case 3: all other possibilities. This case includes all situations where at some point 
					throughout the cycle, there are people who have moved right 1 seat and people who have 
					moved left 1 seat. For example, if Person 1 originally sits in seat A, Person 2 originally 
					sits in seat B, and Person 1 and 2 swap seats, then Person 1 moved right, Person 2 moved 
					left. There are 3 main subcases for this instance.
					<br><br>
					Subcase 1: People 1 & 2, People 3 & 4, and People 5 & 6 are grouped together. They may either 
					swap with each other or not swap. Since each group has 2 different choices, there are 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 
					ways. However, we already counted in the first case the way where no one moves, so we must subtract 
					1 way from our 8 ways which leaves us with 7 ways in this subcase.
					<br><br>
					Subcase 2: People 6 & 1, People 2 & 3, and People 4 & 5 are grouped together. They may either swap 
					with each other or not swap. Since each group has 2 different choices, there are 2×2×2=8 ways. 
					However, we already counted in the first case the way where no one moves, so we must subtract 1 
					way from our 8 ways which leaves us with 7 ways in this subcase.
					<br><br>
					Subcase 3: Any case where 1 pair from subcase 1 swaps and 1 pair from subcase 2 swaps. For example, 
					People 1 & 2 could swap, People 4 & 5 could swap, and People 3 & 6 must stay the same because 
					there is no adjacent space next to them that is available. There are a total of 3 ways possible 
					to choose pairs (1 & 2 with 4 & 5; 3 & 4 with 6 & 1; 5 & 6 with 2 & 3). Another way to count these 
					cases is by counting the pairs of people that don’t move (1 & 4; 2 & 5; 3 & 6). 
					<br><br>
					In total, there are 1 + 2 + 7 + 7 + 3 = 20 ways.</li>
					
					<li>Draw a perpendicular from point <span class="math">A</span> to line <span class="math">CD</span> 
					and let the intersection be point <span class="math">E</span>. Then, using the Pythagorean Theorem: 
					
					<span class="centerdE">
						〖AE〗^2+ 〖ED〗^2= 〖AD〗^2 <br>
					</span>
					
					Let <span class="math">BC = x</span> and <span class="math">CD = y</span>. We are given that 
					<span class="math">CD = AD</span>, so <span class="math">AD</span> is also equal to 
					<span class="math">y</span>. <span class="math">ABCE</span> is a rectangle because we are 
					given that angle <span class="math">B</span> and <span class="math">C</span> are right angles 
					and <span class="math">AE</span> is perpendicular to <span class="math">CE</span> too. Since 
					<span class="math">ABCE</span> is a rectangle, <span class="math">CE</span> = 2 and 
					<span class="math">AE = BC = x</span>. <span class="math">DE</span> is equal to 
					<span class="math">CD</span> minus <span class="math">CE</span> which is equal to 
					<span class="math">y</span> – 2. Using substitution, the equation <span class="math">
					〖AE〗^2 + 〖ED〗^2 = 〖AD〗^2</span> can be rewritten as:
					
					<span class="centerdE">
						x^2 + 〖(y - 2)〗^2= y^2 <br>
						x^2 + y^2 - 4y + 4 = y^2 <br>
						x^2 = 4y - 4 <br>
						x^2 = 4(y - 1) <br>
					</span>
					
					The equation above shows that <span class="math">y</span> is 1 more than a perfect square. The perimeter, 
					<span class="math">AB + BC + CD + AD</span> = 2 + <span class="math">x + y + y = p</span>, must be smaller 
					than 2015. 
					<br><br>
					After trying a few numbers, if <span class="math">y</span> = 31^2 + 1 = 962, then 
					<span class="math">p</span> > 2015. However, if <span class="math">y</span> = 32^2 + 1 = 1025, 
					<span class="math">p</span> is no longer smaller than 2015. So, <span class="math">y</span> 
					= 31^2 + 1 is the upper limit for <span class="math">y</span>.
					<br><br>
					For the lower limit of <span class="math">y</span>, <span class="math">y</span> cannot be equal 
					to 0^2 + 1 = 1 because then <span class="math">x</span> would equal 0 and a side with length 0 
					wouldn’t exist. However, if <span class="math">y</span> = 1^2 + 1 = 2, <span class="math">x</span> 
					would equal 4 which is valid. So, <span class="math">y</span> = 1^2 + 1 is the lower limit for 
					<span class="math">y</span>.
					
					In total, there are 1 to 31 which is 31 different possible values. </li>
